# Overview
  This analysis was conducted to gain a better understanding of trends in CitiBike data from New York City through the data provided. Below are the graphs of my findings:
  
# Results
  
![tripduration](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/user_checkout.png)
  
- Looking at the trip duration by all users, I found that most trips are around 30 minutes or less with a 5 minute duration being the most common
- Below is the same information, but separated by gender to determine demographics

![duration_gender](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/gender_checkout.png)

- Through this we can see that males take account for more than 3x the rides compared to females
- The average female trip is slightly longer at 6 minutes versus 5 minutes

![bike_repairs](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/bike_repairs.png)

- This graph groups bikes by color, the darker the color the more the bikes are used
- This is useful to get a general idea of what bikes will more likely need repairs based on usage

![bike_utilization](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/bike_utilization.png)

- Using trip duration as a variable instead of trip numbers, we can tell what bikes are used the longest
- This can help determine what bikes will have the most wear in order to repair them

![user_types](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/user_trips.png)

- Sorting by user type, gender, and weekday we can see that most CitiBike users are male subscribers

![trips_by_weekday](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/trips_by_weekday.png)

- The least busy time tend to be on Mondays between 2-4AM, this time would be the most ideal to perform the majority of repairs
- Through this we can also see that Thurdays between 5-6PM are the most busy

![trips by gender](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/bikesharing/blob/main/Analysis/trips_by_gender.png)

- Males account for the majority of the users compared to females
- The most common start times among both groups are 8AM and 5-6PM so we can assume that most users utilize CitiBike to commute to and from work

# Summary
  Using this data, we can see that CitiBikes tend to be used the most by people commuting to and from work for an average ride time of 5 minutes. This is shown by the graph that displays usage hourly by weekday and also the trip duration graph. We can also determine the best time to perform repairs so that our customers would be the least impacted. The best time to do weekly maintenence would be Monday mornings between 4 and 6AM. Using the graph that displays bike utilization, we can also determine which bikes are used for the longest amount of time to be able to focus more on bikes that could need more urgent repairs. 
  For future analysis, I think it would be interesting to compare weather data affects CitiBike users to daily usage. Another thing that might be interesting to look at is summer months to visualize how this data might change with the inclusion of summer tourists.
